        I'm Hans from the Philippines, happy to join you guys and have a very
        fruitful block 2 this semester. I'm a lover of the arts, I try to find
        the creativeness in all things I find tasks or work much more
        interesting when creativity is used, it makes work less monotonous. I
        also love learning skills that I can instantly practice on, making me
        more of an applied learner than theoretical.

        Rizal, officially the Province of Rizal (Filipino: Lalawigan ng Rizal),
        is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in
        Luzon. Its capital is the city of Antipolo. It is about 16 kilometers
        (9.9 mi) east of Manila. The province is named after Jos√© Rizal, one of
        the main national heroes of the Philippines. It is bordered by Metro
        Manila to the west, Bulacan to the north, Quezon to the east and Laguna
        to the southeast. The province also lies on the northern shores of
        Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country. Rizal is a mountainous
        province perched on the western slopes of the southern portion of the
        Sierra Madre mountain range.
