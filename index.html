        <p>I'm Hans from the Philippines, happy to join you guys and have a very fruitful block 2 this semester. I'm a lover of the arts,  I try to find the creativeness in all things I find tasks or work much more interesting when creativity is used, it makes work less monotonous. I also love learning skills that I can instantly practice on, making me more of an applied learner than theoretical.</p>
